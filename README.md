- [figure 5](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F5_DANCE_add-riboswitch.html)

They can also be viewed interactively without installing or downloading
anything. To do this click on the link below and wait for Jupyter Lab to launch
in your browser. This may take a few minutes on the server side.
