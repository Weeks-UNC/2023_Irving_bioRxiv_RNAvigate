# RNAvigate_figures

This repository contains the processed data and Jupyter notebooks used in the
creation of figures for the RNAvigate manuscript.

There are three options to view these notebooks:

## 1. Static web pages

[figure 1](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F1_simple_plots.html),
[figure 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F2_smCCP_tmRNA.html),
[figure 3](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F3_lowSS_DENV.html),
[figure 4](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F4_tr-folding_RNaseP.html),
[figure 5](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F5_DANCE_add-riboswitch.html),
[figure 6](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/blob/main/static_notebooks/F6_compare_SARS2.html)

## 2. Interactive notebooks on the web with Binder

No installations or downloads are required. It can take a few minutes for
Binder to start a new server.

- [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate_figures/HEAD)

Once the Jupyter Lab server is running, open a notebook and hit the double-play
button in the top ribbon (restart and run all cells) to run the python code
contained in the notebook. Figures will dissapear breifly and be recreated.

Currently, there are some differences in the Binder installation of RNAvigate
vs the standard installation, and some code warnings may show up. These can
safely be ignored.

Notebook files can be found at the following locations in the left panel:

- interactive_notebooks/
  - figure_1/F1_simple_plots.ipynb
  - figure_2/F2_smCCP_tmRNA.ipynb
  - figure_3/F3_lowSS_DENV.ipynb
  - figure_4/F4_tr-folding_RNaseP.ipynb
  - figure_5/F5_DANCE_add-riboswitch.ipynb
  - figure_6/F6_compare_SARS2.ipynb


## 3. Interactive notebooks on your local machine

Download this repository (RNAvigate_figures). In order to view the Jupyter
notebooks, you will need a working RNAvigate installation:

  - [RNAvigate source code](https://github.com/Weeks-UNC/RNAvigate)
  - [RNAvigate documentation](https://rnavigate.readthedocs.io)

In future versions of RNAvigate, syntax changes may prevent these notebooks from
running properly. If that is the case, here is the hard link to the version of
RNAvigate used in these notebooks.
